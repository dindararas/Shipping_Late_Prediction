# LATE DELIVERY PREDICTION

## üì¶ PROBLEM STATEMENT
DataCo global company has been struggling with late deliveries. Out of 180K transactions over the period of 2015 - 2017, **55% orders were shipped late**. This issue led to customer dissatisfaction and loss revenue. This project will be focused on late delivery that arise in the company, including risk assessment and predicting delay probability. You can find streamlit version of this project [here](https://shipping-late.streamlit.app/)

## üéØ OBJECTIVES
This project aims to :
1. Identify key risk factors influencing late delivery risk
2. Develop ML-based models to predict delay risk
3. Derive Actionable Insights

## üìä DATASET OVERVIEW

## üîé KEY FINDINGS
### Shipping Mode
<img width="533" height="171" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3db24e40-b5f9-4ce1-9d9c-f59250240ff8" />

**Insights** :
1. Surprisingly, First Class shipping had the lowest on-time rate (4.68%), while Standard Class achieved the highest on-time rate at 61.93% 
2. Second Class shipping had a low on-time rate of 23.37% with deliveries up to 4 days later than scheduled
3. With on-time rate of 54.26%, Same Day delivery were shipped either on schedule or delayed by one day

### Seasonality Analysis
<img width="297" height="193" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/024b02df-4691-4866-92b1-f8a1c97071e3" />

**Insights** : 
1. Overall, smaller quantity volume led to higher on-time rate, indicating that delayed delivery is influenced by shipment volume
2. On-time rate was quite stable at 44.5% - 46% from January to December with the lowest rate occurring in March and September (44.5%) and the highest rate occurring in April (45.9%)
3. December had both the lowest total quantity sold and relatively low on-time rate, indicating that shipped volume did not influence low on-time rate this month
Despite a high volume of shipped products, January still achieved the second-highest on-time rate

### Store Analysis
<img width="283" height="172" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b84f4a66-4a3b-4f09-940e-d92a95ccd398" />

**Insights** :
On average, stores/warehouses in the e-commerce had an actual lead time of 3.5 days and an expected lead time of 2.9 days, making the shipping day gap at 0.6 days
More than half of total stores/warehouses (54.3%) shipped their products later than expected by more than 0.6 days, with the worst delay reaching 4 days

### Model Comparison

**Insights** :
Random Forest and Decision Tree are overfitting to the training data, shown by all the metric scores of 1
Although Logistic Regression and XGBoost are good for data generalization, these models are possibly underfitting
There is no difference in model performance between original dan outlier handling

### Hyperparameter Tuning
<img width="252" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eaf21f7-353b-47dd-a368-6c950bf69364" />
<img width="212" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38f6c099-ca95-4178-98c7-2fb361651b88" />

**Insights**:
1. Hyperparameter tuning has improved XGBoost performance, despite making it overfitting (all the metric scores on training data =1)
2. **False Positive Rate (0.08)** : About 8% of on-time delivery were incorrectly predicted as late delivery risk
3. **False Negative Rate (0.08)** : About 8% of late delivery were incorrectly predicted as on-time

### Feature Importance
Features importance from XGBoost model's prediction :
* `Days for shipment (scheduled)` : this feature has the highest importance (+1.76) for predicting late delivery risk. The result highlights that estimating the required shipping days is essential to reduce the probability of delayed delivery by allocating resources and time efficiently
* `Customer Street_encoded` : although customer street is not directly related to order destination, this feature ranks second for the highest importance (+0.92)
* `Shipping Mode_encoded` : this feature ranks third for the highest importance (+0.79). As shown in the EDA section, the choice of shipping mode influence the probability of delayed delivery
* `Order City_en_encoded` and `Type_encoded` : these features have relatively high importance (+0.62 and +0.66, respectively) which indicate that payment type and destination city influence late delivery risk. This makes sense since order destination is related to distance. Meanwhile, the duration of payment confirmation can also influence late delivery
* `shipping_month` and `shipping_hours` : some months/hours with high shipping volumes led to higher late delivery risk

## ‚úç BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
**1. Adjust Shipping Schedules**
* Develop model to estimate actual shipping days more accurately
* Extend shipping days to lower late delivery risk

**2. Optimize Warehouse Locations**
* Establish warehouses near regions with the highest number of orders
* **Cons** : need high cost to build new warehouses

**3. Route Optimization**
* Develop routing algorithm to make shipping efficient
* Cluster nearby regions, so deliveries can be completed faster and more efficiently

**4. Optimize Shipping Mode Performance**
* Evaluate First Class shipping mode and improve its performance
* Remove shipping modes with low on-time rate and high costs

**5. Plan Shipping During Peak Seasons/Hours**
* Allocate extra resources during peak months
* Prioritize early day shipping for high-risk orders

**6. Optimize Payment Process**
* Speed up payment confirmation to reduce delays
